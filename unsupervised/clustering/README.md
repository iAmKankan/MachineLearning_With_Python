### K-means Clustering
### What is Clustering?
$\large{\color{Purple}\text{Answer:}}$ Clustering is an **unsupervised machine learning technique** that automatically groups **unlabeled data points** based on similarity. Grouping items with similar characteristics helps identify natural, hidden patterns within datasets. Common applications include **market segmentation**, **image segmentation**, **anomaly detection**, and **data compression**.
* **Goal**: Discover the natural grouping or structure in unlabeled data without predefined categories.
* **How**: Data points are assigned to clusters based on similarity or distance measures.
* **Similarity Measures**: Can include Euclidean distance, cosine similarity or other metrics depending on data type and clustering method.
* **Output**: Each group is assigned a cluster ID, representing shared characteristics within the cluster.
### Core Concepts of Clustering
* **Unsupervised Learning**: No predefined tags or labels are used; the algorithm finds structure independently.
* **Similarity Metrics**: Data points are grouped based on proximity using metrics like Euclidean distance or cosine similarity.
* **Intra-cluster Similarity**: Objects in the same cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters.
### What is K-Means Clustering?
$\large{\color{Purple}\text{Answer:}}$ **K-Means Clustering** groups similar data points into clusters without needing labeled data. It is used to uncover hidden patterns when the goal is to organize data based on similarity.

Helps identify natural groupings in unlabeled datasets
Works by grouping points based on distance to cluster centers
Commonly used in customer segmentation, image compression, and pattern discovery
Useful when you need structure from raw, unorganized data
