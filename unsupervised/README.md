###  ⬛ $\Large{\color{Blue}\mathcal{Unsupervised\ Machine\ Learning}}$
### ♠️ <ins>What is Unsupervised Machine Learning</ins>? 
$\Large Answer:$ Unsupervised learning, also known as unsupervised machine learning, uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets. These algorithms discover hidden patterns or data groupings without the need for human intervention.
Its ability to discover similarities and differences in information make it the ideal solution for exploratory data analysis, cross-selling strategies, customer segmentation, and image recognition.

### ♠️ <ins>How does unsupervised learning work</ins>? 
$\Large Answer:$  Unsupervised learning works by analyzing unlabeled data to identify patterns and relationships. The data is not labeled with any predefined categories or outcomes, so the algorithm must find these patterns and relationships on its own. This can be a challenging task, but it can also be very rewarding, as it can reveal insights into the data that would not be apparent from a labeled dataset.

The input to the unsupervised learning models is as follows: 

* $\large{\color{Purple}\textrm{Unstructured data:}}$ May contain noisy(meaningless) data, missing values, or unknown data. Example: Digital photos, audio, and video files
* $\large{\color{Purple}\textrm{Unlabeled data:}}$ Data only contains a value for input parameters(features), there is no targeted value(lebel or output or Y). It is easy to collect as compared to the labeled one in the Supervised approach.

### Unsupervised Learning Algorithms
There are mainly 3 types of Algorithms which are used for Unsupervised dataset.
* $\large{\color{Purple}\textrm{Clustering}}$
* $\large{\color{Purple}\textrm{Association Rule Learning}}$
* $\large{\color{Purple}\textrm{Dimensionality Reduction}}$
