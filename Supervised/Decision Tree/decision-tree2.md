In the theory lectures we have already seen the different options available to us when building binary trees for example the 
* first thing we have to consider is the **type of tree** which we want to build we can either have **binary trees** or **multi way trees** depending upon the **branching factor** at each node
* another option available to us is the **impurity measure** used in this tutorial we will be looking at two different impurity measures which are **cross entropy** and the **Gini index**.
* Another option which we do not consider here is the **pruning technique** used.

### <ins>Cross Entrophy</ins>

$$\Large{\color{Purple} \mathrm{Cross\ Entropy} = - \sum_{k=1}^{K} \hat{p}\_{mk} \log \hat{p}\_{mk}}$$


* $\large{\color{Purple}S}$ represents the **data set** that entropy is calculated.
* $\large{\color{Purple}c}$ represents the **classes** in set $\large{\color{Purple}S}$
* $\large{\color{Purple}p(c)}$ represents the **proportion of data points** that belong to **class** $\large{\color{Purple}c}$ to the number of total data points in the set $\large{\color{Purple}S}$

### <ins>Gini Index</ins>

$$\Large{\color{Purple} \mathrm{Gini\ Index} = \sum_{k\neq k^{\prime}} \hat{p}\_{mk} \ \hat{p}\_{mk^{\prime}} = \sum_{k=1}^{K}  \hat{p}\_{mk} ( 1 - \hat{p}\_{mk})}$$


### ðŸ”² $\large{\color{Purple}\underline{\textrm{Multiway Split Using Cross-entrophy}}}$
To start with let us try and build a tree using **multi-way splits** and **cross entropy** as the **impurity measure**, the first thing that we have to do is to identify the **root node** this is done by considering each attribute in turn calculating the **cross entropy value** for that **attribute** and **identifying the attribute** which uses the **lowest** value let us start by 
* Considering the attribute **age**.
