In the theory lectures we have already seen the different options available to us when building binary trees for example the 
* first thing we have to consider is the **type of tree** which we want to build we can either have **binary trees** or **multi way trees** depending upon the **branching factor** at each node
* another option available to us is the **impurity measure** used in this tutorial we will be looking at two different impurity measures which are **cross and entropy** and the **Gini index**.
* Another option which we do not consider here is the **pruning technique** used.
